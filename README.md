# Realtime ChatApp using ReactJs, ExpressJs, and socket.io
## Using Socket.io and ExpressJs as backend and ReactJs as frontend , I created a secret realtime chatApp in which participants have to join the correct room in order to communicate with each other, the app keeps track of how many people are in the room, their ids and who joined and who left.
