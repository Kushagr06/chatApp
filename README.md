# Realtime ChatApp using ReactJs, ExpressJs and socket.io
## Using Socket.io and ExpressJs as backend and ReactJs with TailwindCSS as frontend, I have created a realtime secret chat application. In this app, participants are required to join the correct chat-room in order to communicate with each other. The app tracks the number of people in the room, their IDs and the participants that join and leave the session.
